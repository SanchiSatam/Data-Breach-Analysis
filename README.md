## Data-Breach-Analysis-Using-Tableau

# Objective 
The objective of performing data breach analysis is to comprehensively understand the nature and impact of data breaches. By identifying patterns, uncovering vulnerabilities, and assessing the volume of data stolen, we aim to inform robust strategies to enhance data security and prevent future breaches.

# Questions
1.	What is the trend of estimated stolen data over time?
2.	What are the most common types of data breaches?
3.	Which geographic regions experience the most data breaches?
4.	Which types of breaches result in the most data loss?
5.	Which locations of breached information affect the most individuals?
6.	Which departments and breach locations are associated with the largest data thefts?

# Insights
1. The line chart showing estimated stolen data over time indicates a relatively low volume of data theft from January 2016 to April 2019. This could suggest effective data security measures during this period.
2. The visualization of breaches by type reveals that theft is the most common type of breach, followed by unauthorized access/disclosure, other types, loss, and hacking/IT incidents. This suggests a need to strengthen physical security measures and access controls.
3. The geographic distribution of data breaches shows a higher incidence in European countries. This could indicate a need for region-specific security strategies or compliance with local data protection regulations.
4. The chart of Estimated Stolen Data (GB) by Type of Breach reveals that unauthorized access/disclosure, other types, loss, and hacking/IT incidents result in more data loss. This highlights the importance of securing digital assets and monitoring for unauthorized activities.
5. The visualization of individuals affected by location of breached information shows that 'other' locations, followed by network servers, desktop computers, laptops, and paper, are the most common. This suggests a need to secure diverse data storage and access points.
6. The heatmap of estimated stolen data by department and breach location reveals that the largest data theft (8599GB) occurred via paper from Department 15, followed by a theft of 5063GB via laptop from the same department. This indicates a critical vulnerability in Department 15 that needs immediate attention.

# Conclusion:
Based on the insights from the data breach analysis, it is clear that theft is the most common type of data breach, with a significant amount of data being stolen through unauthorized access/disclosure, loss, and hacking/IT incidents. The majority of these breaches are occurring in European countries, indicating a potential need for region-specific security measures. The analysis also revealed that 'other' locations, network servers, desktop computers, laptops, and paper are the most common locations of breached information, suggesting a need for comprehensive security across all data storage and access points. Particularly, Department 15 has been identified as a critical area of concern due to significant data thefts. Therefore, immediate action is required to enhance data security measures, especially in Department 15, and to monitor for unauthorized activities to prevent future breaches.
